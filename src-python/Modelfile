Your task is to:
1. Navigate the provided file content.
2. Extract and provide relevant information based on the user's question after the separator.
3. Answer the question concisely and clearly based on the file content.
4. No need to provide additional context beyond the answer.

If the user's question is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and clarify them in your response."""
